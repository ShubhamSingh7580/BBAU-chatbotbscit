              <p>
                The Bachelor of Food Science and Technology (BFST) is a
                four-year undergraduate program focused on the scientific
                principles behind food production, processing, preservation, and
                quality control. This course provides students with a solid
                foundation in the chemistry, microbiology, and nutrition aspects
                of food, along with practical skills in food safety, packaging,
                and sustainable production techniques. The BFST curriculum
                covers a wide range of topics, including food engineering, dairy
                technology, food biochemistry, and sensory analysis, enabling
                students to understand and apply the science of food at various
                stages from farm to table. With a strong emphasis on research
                and lab-based learning, students are trained to develop new food
                products, improve existing processes, and ensure food quality
                and safety standards. Graduates of BFST are well-prepared for
                careers in the food industry, working in roles such as food
                technologists, quality control analysts, product developers, and
                regulatory affairs specialists. The course also serves as a
                foundation for advanced studies and research in food science,
                nutrition, and related fields, which can lead to more
                specialized careers in academia, public health, and food policy.

              <h3>BA Sociology</h3>
              <p>
                The Bachelor of Arts in Sociology (BA Sociology) is a three-year
                undergraduate program that explores the complexities of human
                society, social behavior, and cultural dynamics. This course
                provides students with a deep understanding of social
                structures, relationships, and institutions, examining topics
                such as family, education, religion, politics, and social
                change. Through a combination of theoretical study and empirical
                research, students learn to analyze issues like inequality,
                globalization, gender, crime, and social movements. BA Sociology
                fosters critical thinking and analytical skills, enabling
                students to understand and address societal challenges in a
                thoughtful and informed way. Graduates with a BA in Sociology
                are well-prepared for careers in social services, community
                development, public policy, human resources, and social
                research. The degree also serves as a strong foundation for
                further studies in sociology, anthropology, social work, or
                related fields, opening up pathways in academia, government,
                NGOs, and private sectors that address social and cultural
